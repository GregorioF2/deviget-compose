#  Deviget compose solution
Compose solution, Server and UI, for deviget transparent cache problem

## Requirements

```
- git
- docker
- docker-compose
```

## Installation
To  run the solution you only have to run from the root folder of this repo the following commands:
``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:GregorioF2/deviget-server.git server

$ docker-compose -p deviget up -d
```
The Server will run by default on the port `3000`, and the UI will run on the port `8080`

## Notes

I uploaded the server in a different repository, because I understood you would wanted to give particular attention to the commits of that solution.
